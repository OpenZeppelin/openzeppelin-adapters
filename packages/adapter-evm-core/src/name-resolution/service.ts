/**
 * EVM name-resolution service — forward path (SF-2).
 *
 * Implements the `NameResolutionCapability` forward surface (`isValidName` + `resolveName`), sans the
 * `RuntimeCapability` mixin the factory adds via `guardRuntimeCapability`. A thin service over viem's
 * `getEnsAddress` (Universal Resolver — ENSIP-10 wildcard + CCIP-Read built in); it constructs no
 * on-chain reader / ABI of its own (Design: "viem's `getEnsAddress` IS the on-chain reader").
 *
 * ## The load-bearing choices
 *
 * - **`strict: true`** on the one `getEnsAddress` call (INV-7, G1 — fund safety): distinct failure
 *   classes surface as typed reverts instead of collapsing into `null`. Under `strict: true` only a
 *   genuine empty-record decode returns `null`; every resolver/gateway/transport failure throws.
 * - **Never throw for expected failures** (INV-6): every anticipated outcome resolves to a
 *   discriminated `{ ok: false, error }`. The sole sanctioned throw is `RuntimeDisposedError`, raised
 *   by the factory's guard proxy *before* this body runs — so it is never observed here.
 * - **Deterministic, total, closed classification** (INV-10/INV-12): a fixed precedence — sync
 *   support-gate → shape gate → normalize → the network call → an ordered `catch` — maps every
 *   outcome onto exactly one member of the closed seven-code `NameResolutionError` union. SF-2 owns
 *   the not-found / unsupported-name / unsupported-network codes on its control path (Part A);
 *   everything else is delegated to SF-1's total `mapNameResolutionError` (Part B).
 *
 * The forward-path native-error → code table (Design D-E) is pinned to **viem@2.44.4**: the UR revert
 * `errorName`s (`ResolverNotFound`, `ResolverNotContract`, `UnsupportedResolverProfile`) are reached
 * via `extractRevertInfo(err).errorName` and pre-classified here; a viem major bump requires
 * re-validating this table and SF-1's mapper.

 * client (INV-21) and without opening a new RPC connection (INV-23).
 *
 * The offchain traversal is observed by wrapping the client-level `ccipRead.request` hook: viem's
 * `offchainLookup` reads `client.ccipRead.request` from the client the action runs on, so a client
 * carrying our wrapper — which flips a **call-local** flag then delegates to the source client's own
 * hook (or viem's default {@link ccipRequest}) — sees every real gateway hop and none of another
 * concurrent call's (each call gets its own client + flag, so `sawOffchain` never cross-contaminates —
 * INV-18).
 *
 * viem pre-binds a client's actions to that client, so overriding `ccipRead` on a shallow clone would
 * be ignored by the source's pre-bound `getEnsAddress`. When the source exposes a reusable transport
 * (`client.request` + `chain` — every real viem client), we therefore build a fresh client over
 * `custom(client)` (which delegates transport requests back to the borrowed client — no new
 * connection, borrowed client untouched) with our `ccipRead` installed. A transport-less client (e.g.
 * a hand-rolled unit-test double that stubs `getEnsAddress` directly and performs no real offchain
 * lookup) is reused as-is with `ccipRead` overridden — there is no gateway hop to observe there.
